| A race condition is a situation in which the program does not give the correct result for some            |
| interleavings of the operations of multiple threads. Race conditions are pernicious because they may      |
| remain latent in a program and appear infrequently, perhaps only under heavy load or when using certain   |
| compilers, platforms, or architectures. This makes them hard to reproduce and diagnose.                   |
|                                                                                                           |

| It is traditional to explain the seriousness of race conditions through the metaphor of financial         |
| loss, so weâ€™ll consider a simple bank account program.                                                    |
|                                                                                                           |
| Let's suppose the following situation: Alice deposits %d, and Bob %d. There is a particular outcome,      
| in which Bob's deposit occurs in the middle of Alice's deposit, after the balance has been read but       |
| before it has been updated, causing Bob's transaction to disappear. This is because Alice's deposit       |
| operation is really a sequence of two operations, a read and a write. What is that special outcome?       |
|                                                                                                           |

| The specia outcome is %d. The expected outcome is %d but we got %d so we say, the Bob's deposit (%d)      
| was lost in heaven. Don't get lost in heaven. The number of attemps that were taken to get the            |
| special outcome were %d.

| also returns the number of attemps that were taken to get that special outcome. It takes two argument a,  |

| Things get even messier if the data race involves a variable of a type that is larger than a single       |

| This function updates concurretly two slices of different lengths. The value of x in the final statement  |
| is not defined; it could be nil, or a slice of length 10, or a slice of length 1,000,000. But recall that |
| there are three parts to a slice: the pointer, the length, and the capacity. If the pointer comes from    |
| the first call to make and the length comes from the second, x would be a chimera, a slice whose nominal  |
| length is 1,000,000 but whose underlying array has only 10 elements. In this eventuality, storing to      |
| element 999,999 would clobber an arbitrary faraway memory location, with consequences that are imposible  |

| There are three ways to avoid data race.                                                                  |
|                                                                                                           |
| 1) The first way is not to write the variable. If instead we initialize with all necessary entries before |
| creating threads and never modify it again, then any number of threads may safely call the related        |
| function. But what can we do if we need to modify the entries? Let's read a little bit more.              |
|                                                                                                           |
| 2) The second way to avoid data race is to avoid accesing the variable from multiple threads and confined |
| it to a single thread. Since other threads cannot access the variable directly, they must use a channel   |
| to send the confinnig thread a request to query or update the variable. This is what is meant by the Go   |
| mantra "Do not communicate by sharing memory; instad, share memory by communicating.".                    |
|                                                                                                           |

| 3) The third way to avoid a data race is to allow many threads to access the variable, but only one at a  |
| time. This approach is known as mutual exclusion and is the subject of the next section.                  |

 AVOID RACE CONDITION SIMULATION
 _______________________________

+-{ Definition }--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                                                           |
| Recall that a race condition is a situation in which the program does not give the correct result for     |
| some interleavings of the operations of multiple threads. Race conditions are pernicious because they may |
| remain latent in a program and appear infrequently, perhaps only under heavy load or when using certain   |
| compilers, platforms, or architectures. This makes them hard to reproduce and diagnose.                   |
|                                                                                                           |

| In the previous Financial Lack Race Condition Simulation we have an issue. If Alice deposits %d, and 
| Bob %d. when Alice or Bob wants to read their bank account, they could get an outcome like this %d 
| instead of %d, which is the correct outcome.
|                                                                                                           |

| Let's run the simulation again but this time we are going to use the adquired knowledge of Avoid Race     |
| Condition section.                                                                                        |
